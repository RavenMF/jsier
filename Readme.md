**Jsier**

**JSON Data Management and Validation in Python**

This Python library provides a set of functions for managing and validating JSON data. The functions can be used to:

* Create new JSON files.
* Load JSON data from files.
* Save JSON data to files.
* Add new data to JSON files.
* Retrieve data from JSON files by ID.
* Remove data from JSON files by ID.
* Validate JSON data against a schema.
* Compare two JSON files and return a diff object.

These functions can be used for a variety of purposes, such as managing databases, developing web applications, and processing data from APIs.

**Usage**

To use the library, simply import it into your Python code:

```python
import jsier
```

Then, you can use the functions in the library to manage and validate your JSON data. For example, to create a new JSON file, you can use the `new_file()` function:

```python
new_file("my_json_file.json")
```

To load JSON data from a file, you can use the `load_data()` function:

```python
data = json_data_management.load_data("my_json_file.json")
```

To save JSON data to a file, you can use the `save_data()` function:

```python
json_data_management.save_data("my_json_file.json", data)
```

To add new data to a JSON file, you can use the `add_data()` function:

```python
new_data = {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30}
json_data_management.add_data("my_json_file.json", new_data)
```

To retrieve data from a JSON file by ID, you can use the `get_data()` function:

```python
data = json_data_management.get_data("my_json_file.json", 1)
```

To remove data from a JSON file by ID, you can use the `remove_data()` function:

```python
json_data_management.remove_data("my_json_file.json", 1)
```

To validate JSON data against a schema, you can use the `validate_json()` function:

```python
schema_file = "my_json_schema.json"
json_data_management.validate_json("my_json_file.json", schema_file)
```

To compare two JSON files and return a diff object, you can use the `diff_json()` function:

```python
diff = json_data_management.diff_json("my_json_file1.json", "my_json_file2.json")
```

**Database Usage**

The functions in this library can be used to manage data in a database. For example, you can use the `load_data()` function to load data from a database into a JSON file. Then, you can use the `validate_json()` function to validate the data against a schema. If the data is valid, you can save it to a new database table using the `save_data()` function.
